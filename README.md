Analyzing stock data

## Overview of Project: 
Steve, a recent graduate, had requested to help him analyzing sytock data for XXXX company for his parents to invest. He was happy with the workbook you prepared for him. We have also created a button to click so that he can analyze an entire dataset. 

He wanted to help him again to do a bit more research for his parents and he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market data in the spreadsheet over the last two years. Our previous code worked well for analyzing a small subset of data (in that case, we had only one ticker (one company). It is harder to analyze many thousands of stocks and even it may take a long time to execute the code. 

In this project, we have edited, or refactor, the code that we wrote to loop through all the data for collecting similar information that we did earlier. Then, we have evaluated if refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is a common strategy coding to make codes more efficient. 

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The spreasdsheet with the whole analysis was uploaded to the GitHub.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
